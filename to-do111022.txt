Get rid of GS, 

11/10/22:
- Dave is now doing the expression and purification of the proteins that we are designing (doing it with Yuda)
- Bill wants sequences by the end of next week
- gene blocks will come after thanksgiving (expression and purification)
Bill Updates:
- Protease cleavage... may not unbind
- Keep peptides to 21 amino acids
- May need to add purposeful destabilization (polar residues towards the end, Leu/Ile -> Ala (little bit of room there), putting in charge)
- Have PDB files ready by next week
- What is a good metric? Take a look for a sequences that we do choose. 
- Bring four peptides... Bring top ten and then the remainder. 

- Loops
- Don't need to model those in... use this GSSGSS(LINKER)GSGGSG

- Joe
- Review of antimicrobial peptides
- Looked through...
 (Dermaspetin: threads very nice for heaptda repeats)
(magainin 2-23: threads very nicely with exception of glutamic acid of Glu position)
- thread these
- Run rosetta (pack the masking peptide)
- energy and pack stat


~/rosetta_bin_linux_2019.35.60890_bundle/main/source/src/apps/public/symmetry/make_symmdef_file.pl -m NCS -p spONT.pdb -a A -b B > spONT.symm
*then, you take the sym file and the input file and use it for design - make sure to return to the right chains

Run all through alphafold
